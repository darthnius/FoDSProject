This repository contains the code used for classification of antibiotic resistance using MALDI-TOF mass spectra data.
The project employs four machine learning models for this classification task.

Repository Structure:

support_vector_machine_v2.py: Implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
RF_v2.py: Implementation of the Random Forest (RF) model.
Logistic_regression.py: Implementation of the Logistic Regression model.
KNNv1.3.py: Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.
overview_data.py: Script for exploring and visualizing the dataset.
